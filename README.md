# nixos-config

My config for my nixos machines and other systems that leverage home manager
using the nix package manager.

Still very much a WIP as I learn some nix stuff.

## TODO

### Neovim

- [ ] Add git diff icons in the gutter
- [x] Lua LSP integration
- [ ] Use q for quiting out of help menus
- [ ] Maybe make git commit quieter?
- [ ] Set descriptions for keybindings in their own files but integrate with whichkey
- [ ] Bash language server integration
- [ ] YAML language server integration
- [ ] Set up cmp/cmdlind and cmp/git

### Nix

- [ ] split out nix config so it's easier to consume home-manager stuff
- [ ] Need nixpkg for ansible language server

### Other

- [ ] Check out wezterm
